I want you to create a **bright, vibrant, and professional portfolio website** using **NestJS for the backend** and **TailwindCSS for the frontend styling**. The website should include:

1. **Homepage**:
   - My name and a short tagline like “Agentic AI Developer | Multi-Agent Systems | Python & OpenAI SDK”
   - Short introduction about me (skills, focus areas)
   - Use **bright and modern colors** with Tailwind classes (buttons, headings, backgrounds)

2. **Skills Section**:
   - Python, OpenAI SDK, Gemini, LangChain, Streamlit, Multi-Agent Systems, Tool-calling, Voice Agents, Chatbots
   - Use **colorful badges / highlight backgrounds** via Tailwind

3. **Projects Section**:
   - Project 1: “Tutor Chatbot for PDFs”
     - Short description
     - Placeholder screenshot / image
     - **Embedded video player on the web page** (use local video file)
     - GitHub link placeholder
   - Project 2: “Voice Agent”
     - Short description + placeholder image
     - **Embedded video player**
     - GitHub link placeholder
   - Add 2–3 more placeholder projects for future expansion
   - Use **bright Tailwind cards / hover effects / colorful buttons** for each project

4. **Blogs Section**:
   - Showcase **3–4 blog posts / previews**
   - Each blog card includes: title, short description, and “Read more” button
   - Use **bright Tailwind cards with hover effects**  
   - Placeholder content easy to replace later

5. **Contact Section**:
   - Email, LinkedIn, GitHub links
   - Optional: downloadable CV
   - Use **highlighted Tailwind buttons / bright colors**

6. **Footer**:
   - Minimalist design
   - Include copyright info or short tagline
   - Keep it simple, clean, and professional

7. **Design and Layout**:
   - Clean, modern, easy navigation (Home, Skills, Projects, Blogs, Contact)
   - Responsive for desktop and mobile using Tailwind classes
   - Videos should play **directly on the website** using HTML video tag with controls

8. **Output**:
   - Complete **NestJS + Tailwind project structure** ready to run on Replit
   - Structured folder for easy editing and updates
   - Placeholder content/images/videos/blogs easy to replace later with real content

Make it **bright, modern, professional, visually attractive**, with **embedded project videos, blog previews, and a minimalist footer**, while keeping navigation and readability simple.
